/*
 * Memory pools library, Public interface
 *
 * API Overview
 *
 * This package provides a memory allocation subsystem based on pools of
 * homogenous objects.
 *
 * Instrumentation is available for reporting memory utilization both
 * on a per-data-structure basis and system wide.
 *
 * There are two main types defined in this API.
 *
 *    pool manager: A singleton object that acts as a factory for
 *                  pool allocators. It also is used for global
 *                  instrumentation, such as reporting all blocks
 *                  in use across all data structures. The pool manager
 *                  creates and provides individual memory pools
 *                  upon request to application code.
 *
 *    memory pool:  An object for allocating homogenous memory blocks.
 *
 * Global identifiers in this module use the following prefixes:
 *    bcm_mpm_*     Memory pool manager
 *    bcm_mp_*      Memory pool
 *
 * There are two main types of memory pools:
 *
 *    prealloc: The contiguous memory block of objects can either be supplied
 *              by the client or malloc'ed by the memory manager. The objects are
 *              allocated out of a block of memory and freed back to the block.
 *
 *    heap:     The memory pool allocator uses the heap (malloc/free) for memory.
 *              In this case, the pool allocator is just providing statistics
 *              and instrumentation on top of the heap, without modifying the heap
 *              allocation implementation.
